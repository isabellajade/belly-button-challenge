## Module 14 Challenge
For this project I used JavaScript, HTML, and the D3 library to create a dashboard with interactive charts to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. You can view the completed dashboard [here](https://isabellajade.github.io/belly-button-challenge/).

## Drop Down Menu
I created a drop down menu that contains that identification numbers of each individual in the study. Selecting a new ID changes the following charts on the page when selected.
