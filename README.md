## Module 14 Challenge
For this project I used JavaScript, HTML, and the D3 library to create a dashboard with interactive charts to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. You can view the completed dashboard [here](https://isabellajade.github.io/belly-button-challenge/).

## Horizontal Bar Chart
I created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in each specificly selected individual.
